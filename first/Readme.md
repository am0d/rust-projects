=== First projects

In this directory is a sample of small projects that I first wrote while learning rust.
I have added a few as time goes on, and have done / do my best to ensure that all the
programs compile with a fairly recent version of Rust.

To build all the programs in this directory, run:

    make clean
    make

The projects are as follows:

    * hello.rs - A small Hello-World program which prints "Hello world from '<arg1>'", where arg1 is the first command line argument (the program name)
