Rust projects

A small repository, containing some programs I've written as I set about learning rust.

Projects:
    - First: some very small, hello-world style programs to get a feel for the language
    - Sorting: Some sample sort algorithm implementations in Rust, along with some basic benchmarking code
    - Crawler: a test of the Rust networking libraries, and a chance for me to try some networking code

All code is available under the MIT license - see License.txt for further details.
