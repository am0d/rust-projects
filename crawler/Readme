A simple web crawler written in Rust.

Note that the code in this directory is *NOT* supposed to be good Rust code -
I'm still in the process of learning Rust and therefore make no guarantees about
the quality of this code.

I'm also aware of a number of deficiencies in the method I use to download pages.

Todo items:
    - create a chain of redirects rather than over-writing the request each time
    - parse the content for any links which we can crawl
    - make the crawler multi threaded

                                                 crash in the std library when
                                                 downloading http://www.google.ca)
